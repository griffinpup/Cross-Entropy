# Cross-Entropy

This is an implementation of the Cross Entropy reinforcement learning algorithm, implemented on the classic CartPole problem.
This solution, as implemented will only work on Cartpole.  The input and output sizes are explicit.  Moreover, the naming
conventions also rely on the problem being CartPole.  This is to increase intuitive understanding of what the algorithm
is actually doing before generalizing it.
